## Ecological Niche Modeling checklist (ENM checklist)     

### What is an ENM checklist?  
Reporting specific modeling methods and metadata is essential to the reproducibility of ecological studies, yet guidelines rarely exist regarding what information should be noted. Here, we provide a checklist - in effect a metadata standard - to guide studies in reporting at least the minimum information necessary for ecological niche modeling (ENM) reproducibility, offering a straightforward way to balance efficiency and accuracy. We encourage the ENM community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and develop this framework further to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work.  

### How do I use it?  
-You may use the checklist as is or modify it to fit your specific needs.
-Here is what it looks like: [link](https://github.com/shandongfx/ENMchecklist/blob/master/ENMchecklist.md)  
-You can download it in various formats: [link](https://github.com/shandongfx/ENMchecklist/tree/master/template%20of%20ENM%20checklist)  

### How do I contribute to it?  
The checklist shall continue to be developed to keep up with the literature and needs of the community. You can use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/shandongfx/ENMchecklist/issues) to suggest or discuss any changes.
